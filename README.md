# School District Analysis

## **Overview of the school district analysis**: The purpose of this analysis was to correct the analysis performed as part of Module 4 as the Math and Reading scores of the 9th Graders at Thomas High School appeared to have been tampered with.
### To that end, we were asked by the School Board to remove all Math and Reading scores of 9th Graders at Thomas High School and replace them with *NaN* to that those altered scores wouldn't skew the various analyses we ran. Once we were able to replace those scores, we re-ran the analysis we completed in Module 4 in order to develop unskewed results.

## **Analysis Results**:
